If you want to send Email to multiple people then you can't use the free version of Mailgun. 
So I have given another server.js that utilises nodemailer and Google App Password to send Email to multiple people without any issues.
You may check that out if you need that functionality.
Also do not forget to remove the text with the brackets before using either of the server.js files :)
